This is a project made by me and my friend.

You can run the code by Makefile(yeah, only on Linux :), will be added on windows aprx. never)

### In-app controls and usage
- WASD to move and numbers for menu navigation

### About game
Da game is a simple labyrinth game including:
player
2 exits,
1-3 fires that spread throughout the game, and will kill you if you just clown around
and a bot, which has 4 difficulties.
1.Rookie - bot just clowns around
2.Easy - bot clown around, but does not step into the fire
3.Medium - goes by optimal path + 2
4.Hard - goes by optimal path(possible to win)

Enjoy
